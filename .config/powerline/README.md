**`othi` vim theme is still experimental, rendering in vim is noticably slowed
down, use `default` for stable**
`config.json` holds parameters on which coloscheme/theme to use

- `themes` holds segments listings and behaviours
- main theme (example `powerline_terminus`) holds powerline
  characters/separators
- i used powerline-gitstatus from [here](https://github.com/jaspernbrouwer/powerline-gitstatus), after installation to get rid of space after branch edit in `path.vimrc.is.using/powerline_gitstatus/segments.py`
`colorschemes` holds coloschemes
